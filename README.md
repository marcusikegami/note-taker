## Installation

Clone the note-taker repo into the directory of your choice. If you have node.js installed, run the command 'npm install' to install all required packages in the node_modules. If you do not have node.js, install it in order to complete installation. Once node has installed all packages, run the command "npm server" to start a local server from the command-line. Navigate to "http://localhost:3001/" to view the running application.

## Usage

Once software has been properly installed and navigating to "http://localhost:3001" returns the note-taker homepage, click the start button. Clicking the plus sign will allow you to input a Note title and note text, and clicking the save button will save the notes to the database. By clicking on a note on the left side, the clicked note will appear in detail on the right side. **delete function TBA**
